Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates comprehensive EDA and linear regression modeling using the Diabetes and Iris datasets from scikit-learn. It includes handling missing values (mean/median imputation), outlier detection, normalization, and regression performance evaluation using RMSE. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and scatter plots are created using seaborn and matplotlib. Additionally, fast_eda and ydata-profiling are explored for automated analysis. The Iris dataset is also analyzed using EDA and classification-related visualizations. This notebook is ideal for those looking to understand real-world data preprocessing and modeling pipelines in Python.
